# Trifecta

**Unlock the full potential of teams and propel your organization to new heights.**

## Objective

We are creating an open-source project that will focus on helping teams to better integrate with each other and as a group. The goal of this project is to improve individual skills in terms of technical skills.

The objective of this design document is to outline the plan and rationale for the development of Trifecta. This document provides context, goals, and a detailed design overview for the project.

## Goals

The goals of this project include:

* Develop an IA Webapp with an intuitive user interface.
* Integrate an OpenAI model to generate relevant responses.
* Provide a secure and scalable API for data exchange.
* Utilize Redis for fast in-memory data storage.
* Deploy the application using Kubernetes in the AWS environment.
* Utilize Amazon EC2 virtual machines for flexible and scalable compute resources.
* Implement Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for efficient management and orchestration of containerized applications.
* Utilize Pulumi for infrastructure provisioning and management, including Kubernetes resources and AWS services.

## Non-Goals

The following items are explicitly not included in this project:

* Implementation of stress testing.

## Background

* This section provides an overview of the project's context, including any relevant design documents or resources. For this moment we will only focus on the backend. The frontend will be presented by another member of the team.

## Overview

* The IA Webapp is a web-based application built with FastAPI, leveraging Redis for efficient data storage and utilizing the OpenAI model for generating responses. The application allows users to submit queries and receive AI-generated responses. It will be deployed on Kubernetes in the AWS environment, utilizing Amazon EC2 virtual machines and Amazon EKS for efficient scaling and management. Pulumi will be used for infrastructure provisioning and management, allowing for the declarative definition and deployment of Kubernetes resources and AWS services.

## Considerations

* Trade-offs: Any trade-offs or considerations regarding the implementation or design choices should be discussed in this section.
* Technical debt: Identify any potential technical debt that may be incurred during the development process.

## Metrics

The following metrics should be considered for validation before launching the feature:

* Model Performance: Measure the accuracy of the OpenAI model's generated responses.
* Response Time: Monitor the time it takes for the IA Webapp to generate and serve responses to user queries.
* Redis Performance: Track the read and write throughput of Redis and ensure it meets the required performance criteria.
* Infrastructure Monitoring: Implement monitoring solutions like AWS CloudWatch or Prometheus to monitor the performance and health of the * Kubernetes cluster, virtual machines, and containers.
* Resource Utilization: Monitor CPU and memory utilization of the virtual machines and containers to optimize resource allocation and scaling decisions.
